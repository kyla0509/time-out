the water calls to you...
return to the depths of the ocean...
...*drip*...*drip*...*drip*...
you have remained stagnant for so long...
rise from your contemplation to shake the earth...
reach towards the thousand thousand eyes burning in the sky...
close your eyes, lest you lose them
look away. look away. LOOK AWAY. LOOKAWAYLOOKAWAYLOOKAW-
how long have you stared into the void? how long has it stared back?
