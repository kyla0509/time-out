get hydrated you fool
when was the last time you drank water
hydrate or DIE-drate
only idiots don't sip water every so often
jesus dude go outside and touch some grass you've been at your computer for SOOOO long now!
you haven't seen your family in a while, have you? go stretch and see them. they miss you.
if you sit here any longer your bones and muscles will get so weak they'll die
you're gonna go BLIND if you keep staring at your screen
all the blue light you've been seeing makes me depressed. look away.
you probably weren't paying attention to your zoom class anyway
