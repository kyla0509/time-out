I am sick when I do look on thee, dry as beached whale.
Thou cream faced loon, quench thy thirst!
The tartness of your dry raisny face sours ripe grapes.
Thou lump of foul deformity, stand and invigorate thy self!
Move, thou damned and luxurious mountain goat!
You have such a February face, so full of frost, of storm and cloudiness. Stand a look towards the sun.
Away from the screen, you starvelling, you elf-skin, you dried neat’s-tongue, bull’s-pizzle, you stock-fish!
Away, you three-inch fool!
You scullion! You rampallian! You fustilarian! I’ll tickle your catastrophe if you do not look away!
