A reminder application! 

Are you feeling unproductive because of Zoom fatigue? Are you often sitting in front of your computer wasting away the day?
Well do we have the app for you! Time Out is an application where you, the user, can set times to keep yourself being productive WHILE also taking into consideration that everyone needs breaks! Choose from a variety of moods for reminders such as mean, pirate, or even owo-ifyed. With the help of entertaining messages, you can be sure to take some *time out* to keep yourself productive, healthy, and entertained! 

## What is it?
Time Out is a reminder application that allows you to choose a time to work and when the timer goes off, it'll display messages with different tips/reminders about stretching, staying hydrated, and resting your eyes! To keep it funny & also interesting, we made several different types of "languages" for reminders you can receive (Pirate, OwO, Eldritch, Angry, Ciphered, Shakespearean, and Normal). You can also decide how many messages you want it to display after your set amount of time.

## What it does
Set a "language" mode and run the program to get desktop reminders to drink water, take a break and stretch, and look away from the screen.

## How we built it
This was build in python using the plyer notification module. We also made use of github.

## Challenges we ran into
Ideally we would have a GUI to set things like number of reminders, time between reminders, and "language". However, time constraints meant we couldn't spend time figuring out how to build that.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
It is fully functional across two different operating systems!

## What we learned
A lot about python.

## What's next for Time Out!
Hopefully? More alert messages, and a GUI or terminal commands to control settings.
