A reminder application! 

Are you feeling unproductive because of Zoom fatigue? Are you often sitting in front of your computer wasting away the day?
Well do we have the app for you! Time Out is an application where you, the user, can set times to keep yourself being productive WHILE also taking into consideration that everyone needs breaks! Choose from a variety of moods for reminders such as mean, pirate, or even owo-ifyed. With the help of entertaining messages, you can be sure to take some *time out* to keep yourself productive, healthy, and entertained! 

## What is it?
Time Out is a reminder application that allows you to choose a time to work and when the timer goes off, it'll display messages with different tips/reminders about stretching, staying hydrated, and resting your eyes! To keep it funny & also interesting, we made several different types of "languages" for reminders you can receive (Pirate, OwO, Eldritch, Angry, Ciphered, and Normal). You can also decide how many messages you want it to display after your set amount of time.
